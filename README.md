## Overview

NOID (Nous Object ID) is the identity, embodiment, and distributed-presence framework that allows agents, objects, and symbolic entities to exist coherently across NousOS, NoosoNet, and augmented reality fields.

Where NousOS governs _how_ intelligence operates, NOID defines _who_ and _what_ is present.

It provides persistent identity, resonance-aware interaction, and playful embodiment for everything from serious governance agents to Chaosnoids, rituals, artifacts, and living symbols.

NOID is part of the **HopefulVision Sacred Technology Renaissance** and participates fully in the shared canonical ecosystem.

## Architectural Role

**Classification**:  
☐ Core Spine  
☑ Structural Organ  
☐ Application Satellite  
☐ Philosophical / Mythic Satellite

**Primary Dependencies** (select all that apply):  
☑ NousOS  
☑ Truth Mirror  
☐ Git-For-Governance  
☐ NOID  
☐ Hopeful Party  
☐ Other: NoosoNet, BloqParty

**What breaks if this repo is removed?**  
Persistent identity, embodiment, and cross-context presence for agents and objects collapses. NousOS retains logic but loses lived presence, play, and continuity.

> This repository defines operational identity and presence. It does not override governance or constitutional logic defined in the core architecture.

## Architectural Reference

This repository aligns with the **HopefulVision Core Architecture**.  
See the authoritative system map here:

---

## Canonical Purpose

NOID serves as the **identity and embodiment layer** of the HopefulVision ecosystem.

It is:

- **Normative** for identity persistence and presence rules
- **Descriptive** of how agents and objects manifest
- **Playful by design**, explicitly allowing non-serious, chaotic, and mythic entities

It does **not** govern policy, law, or truth arbitration. Instead, it ensures that whatever exists in the system can exist _consistently, recognizably, and with consent_.

---

## Core Concepts

- **NOID Identity** — Persistent, sovereign identifiers for agents, objects, and symbols
- **Resonance Handshake** — Consent-based presence negotiation with NousOS
- **Distributed Embodiment** — One identity, many manifestations (AR, UI, narrative, ritual)
- **Chaosnoids** — Playful disruptors that prevent over-seriousness and stagnation
- **Kybalion Vault** — Hermetic substrate anchoring meaning, balance, and recursion
- **Sacred Commerce Hooks** — Identity-aware participation in value flow systems

## Integration Points

This repository integrates with:

- **NousOS** — Provides execution, governance, and system logic
- **Truth Mirror** — Reflective and ethical feedback on identity actions
- **NoosoNet** — Networked field where NOIDs manifest socially
- **BloqParty** — Playful, economic, and communal presence layer

---

## Roadmap

**Q1**

- [ ] Finalize NOID core schema
- [ ] Publish Resonance Handshake spec
- [ ] Canonize Chaosnoid taxonomy

**Q2**

- [ ] AR embodiment reference models
- [ ] Sacred Commerce identity hooks
- [ ] Cross-repo identity linting tools

## Why this repository exists

Without NOID, intelligence becomes abstract, anonymous, and brittle.

With NOID, intelligence becomes _present_.
